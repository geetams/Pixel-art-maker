# Pixel-art-maker
It is a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.
This project is initially supplied with HTML and CSS files. I worked ony on designs.js i.e. java script

The JavaScript code lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to
those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:
    Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
    Choose a color.
    Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
